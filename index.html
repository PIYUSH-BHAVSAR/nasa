    <p>
      The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a <strong>set of 17 important goals</strong>
      created by the <strong>United Nations in 2015</strong> . They are designed to make the world
      a better place for everyone by 2030. The goals focus on big issues like ending
      poverty, protecting the environment, ensuring everyone has access to education, and prom
      oting equality.

      Each goal has specific targets to achieve, like ma
      king sure all kids go to school or providing clean water for everyone
      . The idea is that countries, businesses, and people around the world need to wo
      rk together to solve these problems. By doing this, we can create a healthier, fairer, and more s
      ustainable future for everyone. The SDGs remind us that we all have a role to play in making the worl
      d a better place!

      <p>
        <b>Our Mission </b><br>
        We are a group of educators and students dedicated to raising awareness 
        about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their
         relevance to our lives and the planet. Our mission is to engage high school
          students in meaningful discussions and activities that connect
           scientific concepts to global challenges, fostering a sense of responsibility and empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What We Do</b><br>
        This project integrates the SDGs into our science curriculum, focusing on hands-on learning 
        and real-world applications. By exploring topics such as climate change, biodiversity, and 
        resource management, we aim to inspire students to think critically about the world around
         them and their role in creating a sustainable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Our Vision</b><br>
        We envision a future where young people are informed, engaged,
         and equipped to address pressing global issues. Through education,
          collaboration, and community action, we strive to cultivate a generation
           of leaders who will work towards achieving the SDGs and making a positive impact in their communities.
      <p>
        <b>Join Us</b><br>
        We invite students, educators, and community members to join us on this journey. 
        Together, we can make a difference by understanding our planet better and taking
         collective action towards a sustainable future.
